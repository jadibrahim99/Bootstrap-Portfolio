                            I was born in Saudi Arabia in 1999, but I moved to Austin, Texas when I was 8 months old. I grew up being a
                            football player, but also a gamer. Technology and progamming has always intersted me, but I never took any
                            concrete step towards furthering my education in programming until my junior year in high school. I decided not
                            to attend college and instead decided to work full time. I eventually became the general manager of a restaurant
                            called zaxby's in 2019, but quickly realized I didn't want to be in restaurant management for the rest of my
                            life.
